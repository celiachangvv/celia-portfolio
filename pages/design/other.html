                        <p>On pages 1-2, I aim to introduce the stunning "Choi Hung Estate" in Hong Kong, renowned for its vibrant and colorful aesthetic. The term "Choi Hung" translates to "Rainbow" in Cantonese, capturing the essence of the residence. To enhance the visual appeal of the outsourced photographs, I meticulously adjusted the color tones, intensifying the saturation to create a more vivid and rainbow-like effect. This effort was made to ensure that the photos truly embody the vibrancy and diversity associated with a rainbow.</p>

                        <p>CAdditionally, to reinforce the thematic coherence of the page, I designed a bespoke rainbow illustration for the title background. This visual element serves to seamlessly align the overall aesthetic of the page with the vibrant and colorful theme inspired by the Choi Hung Estate.</p>
